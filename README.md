# Netclicks-JS-workshop
 
This project - just was at workshop. We are talking about a site like Netflix (but not about it). 

It uses only <strong>vanilla JavaScript</strong> and https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api - <strong>API</strong>. 

I don't think that this project can be taken as the basis of my work, because I did it at a workshop, and I didn't have to think much, because everything was done "as it is". So this is just a project that I will sometimes rely on, or maybe make a similar one myself. The idea and operation of this site surprise me because I have never worked with the API, except with a bot in telegram.

Well, I'll tell you about <strong>the functionality</strong>:<br>
<ul>
 <li>Search for any site and display it on the screen;</li>
 <li>Modal window with additional information about the series;</li>
 <li>Pop-up menu on the left;</li>
 <li>Buttons in the menu: 'top', 'today', 'week' etc;</li>
 <li>Pagination for responded cards;</li>
 <li>The download icon when uploading content</li>
</ul>
